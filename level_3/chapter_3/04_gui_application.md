# A simple GUI application

## Building a GUI application from scratch
Now we're going to build a very simple and rather useless GUI application. Does that sound weird? Maybe, but the application, when ready, will make you more accustomed to some `tkinter` **habits** and **conventions**.

Our fabulous goal will look like the vision presented below:

Are you ready? Let's start.

As everyone knows, Rome wasn't built in a day, and our application isn't an exception. We'll start with something absolutely **obvious** – we'll construct a window and launch an event controller – look at the code in the editor to see how to do it.
```python
import tkinter as tk

window = tk.Tk()
window.mainloop()
```
Our window looks like this one for now:

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/app_2.png">
</p>

There's nothing surprising yet. Let's add something to this dull gray area.

Our new friend is called `Label` – a non-clickable widget able to **present short textual information**, passed to the widget's constructor using a `text` argument. The text can later be changed at any moment of the widget's life.

As you can see, we're using the `pack()` geometry manager to compose the window.
```python
import tkinter as tk

window = tk.Tk()

label = tk.Label(window, text = "Little label:")
label.pack()

window.mainloop()
```
Let's welcome `Label` into our window:

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/app_3.png">
</p>

Note: `pack()` resizes the window to a size large enough to fit all the packed widgets. This is its default behavior. Don't worry, the window will grow soon.

Our next companion will be `Frame`.

A `Frame` is another non-clickable component used to **group widgets** and to separate them (visually) from other window components. Our `Frame` plays a less important role – it just occupies a rectangle and fills it with its own color. We expect nothing more for now.

Let's check it out.
```python
import tkinter as tk

window = tk.Tk()

label = tk.Label(window, text="Little label:")
label.pack()

frame = tk.Frame(window, height=30, width=100, bg="#000099")
frame.pack()

window.mainloop()
```
This is how the `Frame` manifests its presence:

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/app_4.png">
</p>

Make our window great again.

Now we invite a `Button` to join our team.

Our `Button` will be completely **mute**, as we haven’t bound anything to its command property. You can change that if you want.
```python
import tkinter as tk

window = tk.Tk()

label = tk.Label(window, text="Little label:")
label.pack()

frame = tk.Frame(window, height=30, width=100, bg="#000099")
frame.pack()

button = tk.Button(window, text="Button")
button.pack(fill=tk.X)

window.mainloop()
```
This is what our window looks like now:

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/app_5.png">
</p>

Our next component is completely **invisible**. You won't find it in the window area.

It's the switch variable. Can't you see it? It's set to hold an object of the `IntVar` class. This object is designed to store **integer** values. "Okay," you may say, "can't we use a regular variable instead?"

**No, we can't**. Objects of the `IntVar` class are used by `tkinter` to **organize internal communication between different widgets**. A regular variable can't play such a role.

If you want such an object to store an integer value, you can't use the assignment operator. The class offers a dedicated method for that purpose, and the method is named `set()`.

Note: we've used the method to store a value of `1` inside the object.
```python
import tkinter as tk

window = tk.Tk()

label = tk.Label(window, text="Little label:")
label.pack()

frame = tk.Frame(window, height=30, width=100, bg="#000099")
frame.pack()

button = tk.Button(window, text="Button")
button.pack(fill=tk.X)

switch = tk.IntVar()
switch.set(1)

window.mainloop()
```
As the window's view hasn't changed, we can go directly to the next step.

The next step adds a brand new widget to our window – it’s a `Checkbutton`.

It’s a **small square** which can be filled with a **tick mark**, or which can be empty.

The `Checkbutton` is primarily used to represent **two-state selections**. In other words, it can be in one of two possible states:
- the **ON** state when the `Checkbutton` is checked/ticked (which can be equated with an **affirmative answer** to some question)
- the **OFF** state when the `Checkbutton` is cleared (you can think of it as a kind of negative answer)

Take a look at the `Checkbutton` constructor – there’s something completely new. Can you see it?
```python
import tkinter as tk

win = tk.Tk()

label = tk.Label(win, text="Little label:")
label.pack()

frame = tk.Frame(win, height=30, width=100, bg="#000099")
frame.pack()

button = tk.Button(win, text="Button")
button.pack(fill=tk.X)

switch = tk.IntVar()
switch.set(1)

checkbutton = tk.Checkbutton(win, text="Check Button", variable=switch)
checkbutton.pack()

win.mainloop()
```
Yes, it’s a `variable` argument. Note – it’s set to the previously created `switch` object. The assignment creates a **bidirectional link** between the object and the widget. How does it work?
- If you check or uncheck the `Checkbutton`, the switch object will **immediately change its state** – it will keep `0` if the widget is unchecked, and `1` otherwise.
- If you change the state of the `switch` object, the `Checkbutton` will **immediately reflect the change** – it means that you don’t need to access the `Checkbutton` itself to check/uncheck it, as you can modify the `switch` value instead.

Look, the `switch` is initially set to `1`. this means that the `Checkbutton` will be checked when it appears on the screen.

Let's check it.

This is what our window looks like now:

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/app_6.png">
</p>

Okay, it definitely looks as expected, but how can we be sure that the `switch` object changes its state according to our clicks addressed to the `Checkbutton`?

Now we add a very important, and internally an extremely complicated, widget, named `Entry`. Look at the code in the editor.
```python
import tkinter as tk

window = tk.Tk()

label = tk.Label(window, text="Little label:")
label.pack()

frame = tk.Frame(window, height=30, width=100, bg="#000099")
frame.pack()

button = tk.Button(window, text="Button")
button.pack(fill=tk.X)

switch = tk.IntVar()
switch.set(1)

checkbutton = tk.Checkbutton(window, text="Check Button", variable=switch)
checkbutton.pack()

entry = tk.Entry(window, width=30)
entry.pack()

window.mainloop()
```
`Entry` is designed to let the user enter simple, one-line data, like single numbers, names, addresses, etc.

We’ve added one to our window. It creates an **input field** 30 characters wide. You can play with it if you want, but it’s completely inoperative as far. We only want to show you what it looks like.

Isn’t our window lovely?

Okay, let’s provide some serious work to our `switch` object.

We’ve added two widgets at once – look!
```python
>import tkinter as tk

window = tk.Tk()

label = tk.Label(window, text="Little label:")
label.pack()

frame = tk.Frame(window, height=30, width=100, bg="#000099")
frame.pack()

button = tk.Button(window, text ="Button")
button.pack(fill=tk.X)

switch = tk.IntVar()
switch.set(1)

checkbutton = tk.Checkbutton(window, text="Check Button", variable=switch)
checkbutton.pack()

entry = tk.Entry(window, width=30)
entry.pack()

radiobutton_1 = tk.Radiobutton(window, text="Steak", variable=switch, value=0)
radiobutton_1.pack()
radiobutton_2 = tk.Radiobutton(window, text="Salad", variable=switch, value=1)
radiobutton_2.pack()

window.mainloop()
```
These are the `Radiobuttons`, **small circles filled with a dot, or not**. The most important difference between `Check-` and `Radiobuttons` lies in the fact that `Checkbuttons` are **solitary** (they work individually) while `Radiobuttons` always work in groups and – note it! – only one of the widgets inside the group can be **checked**. Clicking an unchecked member of the group will cause the currently checked `Radiobutton` to change its state.

How do we achieve such an effect? The switch object will help us with it.

Our two `Radiobutton` constructors use **two additional arguments**. What roles do they play?
- The `variable` argument binds a `switch` object to both of the widgets, and this is the clue – the fact that both `Radiobuttons` are bound to the same object creates the group. Don’t forget that!
- The `value` argument distinguishes the `Radiobuttons` inside the group, and thus each of the `Radiobuttons` has to use a **different** value (we’ve used `0` and `1`)

The communication through the `switch` object should work as follows:
- selecting one of the `Radiobuttons` affects the `switch` object, which changes its value to **one of the possible values** specified in the `Radiobuttons`’ constructor; note: the mechanism works in the same way if there are more `Radiobuttons` in the group;
- simultaneously, changing the `switch` object’s state affects the `Radiobutton` group.

As the `switch` is initially set to `1`, we expect the second `Radiobutton` (named `Salad`) to be selected when the application starts.

Do you want to check it? Go ahead!

We hope we’ve lived up to your expectations:

There is something more you should note. As the `Checkbutton` and `Radiobutton` groups are coupled together by the switch object, their changes are **synchronized**.

Check this carefully!

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/app_9.png">
</p>

If you check/uncheck the `Checkbutton`, the `Radiobutton` group will follow the change immediately and vice versa, while switching the active `Radiobutton` inside the group will automatically check/uncheck the `Checkbutton`.

Now you’re ready to dive deeper into `tkinter`.

Let’s dive together.
