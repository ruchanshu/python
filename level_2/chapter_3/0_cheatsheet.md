## Summary

### Object-Oriented Programming
1. A **class** is an idea (more or less abstract) which can be used to create a number of incarnations â€“ such an incarnation is called an **object**.
2. When a class is derived from another class, their relation is named **inheritance**. The class which derives from the other class is named a **subclass**. The second side of this relation is named **superclass**. A way to present such a relation is an **inheritance diagram**, where:
   - superclasses are always presented **above** their subclasses;
   - relations between classes are shown as arrows directed **from the subclass toward its superclass**.
3. Objects are equipped with:
   - a **name** which identifies them and allows us to distinguish between them;
   - a set of **properties** (the set can be empty)
   - a set of **methods** (can be empty, too)
4. To define a Python class, you need to use the `class` keyword. For example:
   ```python
   class This_Is_A_Class:
        pass
   ```
5. To create an object of the previously defined class, you need to use the class as if it were a function. For example:
   ```python
   this_is_an_object = This_Is_A_Class()
   ```
6. A **stack** is an object designed to store data using the **LIFO** model. The stack usually performs at least two operations, named `push()` and `pop()`.
7. Implementing the stack in a procedural model raises several problems which can be solved by the techniques offered by **OOP** (**O**bject **O**riented **P**rogramming):
8. A **class method** is actually a function declared inside the class and able to access all the class's components.
9. The part of the Python class responsible for creating new objects is called the **constructor**, and it's implemented as a method of the name `__init__`.
10. Each class method declaration must contain at least one parameter (always the first one) usually referred to as `self`, and is used by the objects to identify themselves.
11. If we want to hide any of a class's components from the outside world, we should start its name with `__`. Such components are called **private**.
